# Examples for the Vamas coordinate system

Here, you can find an example for the coordinate system that is typically used in XPS and other surface science techniques. This is also the coordinate system which is defined by default in [NXxps](https://fairmat-nfdi.github.io/nexus_definitions/classes/contributed_definitions/NXxps.html#nxxps).

See [here](https://fairmat-nfdi.github.io/pynxtools-xps/reference/explanations/coordinate_system.html) for documentation.
