The reader supports [Phi MultiPak](https://www.phi.com/surface-analysis-equipment/genesis.html#software:multi-pak-data-reduction-software/) .spe (single spectra) and .pro (sputter profile / external parameter scan / ....) files, which is the propietary format of PHI Electronics used for their VersaProbe 4 instrumens. The Phi MultiPak software version that was used to measure this data is SS 3.3.3.2.1.
